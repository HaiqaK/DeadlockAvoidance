# CP386_A04

# Motivation 

# Installation
1. Download the repository onto your system
2. Rename makefile.mk to makefile, run:
``` mv makefile.mk Makefile```
3. Makefile is in the same folder as your .c file to compiled run
``` make```
4. This will compile your program with warnings turned into errors. If you instead run
``` make warning_OK```
this will compile your program with warning enabled but not fatal. If successful (ie gcc didnt complain) you should now have a file name Assignment_4 (with no file extention)
5. To run the program use 
``` ./Assignment_4 a b c ... y z ```
